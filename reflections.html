<h1>Conditionals</h1>
<p>Conditionals are instances that pertain to a situation that you created/coded. This can give the user a chance to assign different outcomes with each situation/decision.</p>
<pre>animal = input("What character would you like to be (cat or dog)? ")
  if animal == "cat":
      cat()
  elif animal =="dog":
      dog()
  else:
      print("Error. Please try again.")</pre>
<img alt = "scratch example of conditionals">
<p>A real life example of <u>conditionals</u> would be getting up and going to school. IF you woke up on time, you would take the bus and make it to school on time, but ELSE IF you woke up but moved too sluggishly, you would need to catch the bus at the next stop, or ELSE where you slept through your alarm and needed to call your parents to pick you up and bring you to school tardy.</p>

<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>Functions are a compile of actions that are executed in order and that you can name and call multiple times. This allows the user to repeat actions many times without needing to rewrite the same lines multiple times, as that would get repetitive.</p>
<pre>def start():
    animal = input("What character would you like to be (cat or dog)? ")</pre>
<img alt = "scratch example of functions">
<p>A real life example of functions would be a recipe. You have pre-set instructions that need to be followed completely in order to create the same product as it promises. If you mess up, then the fod won't be the same as yours.</p>

<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>Variables are names assigned to something else within a code; It is a definition for the computer. They are given by the user, and after being defined, can be refered to by the variable name.</p>
<pre>d_name = input("What would you like to name your dog? ")</pre>
<img alt = "scratch example of variables">
<p>A real life example of variables would be a book. A name is given to an object that is a compilation of words and pages, and it is called a 'book'</p>

<h1>Loops</h1>
<p>Loops are a repeating function, that allows the user to reiterate through a block of code for a set number of times. This allows usage for actions that require changing the situation, but still repeating it.</p>
<pre>while x > 5:
    print("numbers")
    x -= 2</pre>
<img alt = "scratch example of loops">
<p>A real life example of loops would be counting down with numbers. You could countdown from 10 to 0 using a while loop.</p>


<!-- Python Data Structures -->
<p>Today I learned more about python data structures. I learned about the method list.index(obj), tuples, list slicing, and append + expand.</p>
<p>A list is an organized collection of items, each assigned its own location/position (with an index). It can be used to store related things that can be grouped, and just be a convenient place to keep things.</p>
